**An introduction of your research question.**
We would like to focus our group project on biking in LA. Some of the potential questions include: 

"What is the relationship between Bike Lanes and Gentrification?" 
"Is there a relationship between bike lanes and collisions?"
"Which bike lanes in LA are the most dangerous?" 

**An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake.** 
Both of us are incredibly passionate about biking. Having grown in car-centric environments made it unsafe for us as children to safely navigate our environments. Even as adults we leave our house on our bikes knowing that we could be hit and die in a traffic collision. If more people felt safe biking, they would drive their car less resulting in less GHGs emitted and congestion on our streets. In the face of climate change, every little reduction counts and cutting down even a small number of car trips could make a substantial dent.  

**A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project.** 
There is a large gap in biking infrastructure between the East and West sides of town. Cyclists are forced to either unsafely ride on the sidewalk, or share the road with other cars. We would like to focus on this area of the city or the valley. 


**A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use (include datasource with links).** 
LA County Bikeways Map (Link: https://github.com/omershomer/GIS_George_and_Omer/tree/main/data/LA%20County%20Bikeways)
LA City Bikeways Map (Link: https://github.com/omershomer/GIS_George_and_Omer/blob/main/data/Bikeways_(Existing).zip)
Vision Zero Priority Corridors (Link: https://github.com/omershomer/GIS_George_and_Omer/blob/main/data/2019_Vision_Zero_Priority_Corridors.csv)
High Injury Network Data (Link: https://github.com/omershomer/GIS_George_and_Omer/blob/main/data/High_Injury_Network.csv)
Census Data by Neighborhood (Link: https://github.com/omershomer/up206a/blob/main/data/Census_Data_by_Neighborhood_Council.csv)

**A description, accompanied by a visual flow chart that explains the methodology for the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project.** 
1. Clean Up Bikeways map data-->2. Isolate desired streets-->3. Map out-->
2. Clean Up secondary data (injury network, census data, neighborhood change index, etc.)-->2. isolate desired neighborhoods-->3.Map out
3. Layer files onto each other and analyze 
**A concluding paragraph of what insights you expect to gain from your research. Figure out what other data is important to collect.** <br><br>
