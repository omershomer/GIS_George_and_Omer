### Week 4 Status Report
<a href="https://github.com/omershomer/GIS_George_and_Omer">Cycling in the City of LA: The Nexus of Urban Design and Traffic Safety</a> <br>

**Roles**: <br> 
George Karam (*Mobility Data Analyst*) will be studying local (LA City/Beverly Hills) mobility plans to better understand the context and culture of alternative modes of transportation in Central Los Angeles. Futher, George will pull data (from the cities and County) on bike infrastructure and land use in the study region. <br>

Omer Sohail (*Sociodemographic Data Analyst*) will be analyzing the factors that influence gentrification (mainly educational attainment, race, and income) in Central Los Angeles. Layered with land-use and transportation data gathered by George, this will allow for our group to reveal any connection between biking infrastructure, gentrification, and displacement in the city. <br>

**Status update**:<br> Optimistic about progress that has been made so far. Currently meeting on a weekly basis to discuss project. <br><br>
**Data update**:<br> <a href="https://github.com/omershomer/GIS_George_and_Omer/tree/main/Group_Assignment_2/.ipynb_checkpoints">Race Profile of LA County</a>, <a href="https://github.com/omershomer/GIS_George_and_Omer/tree/main/Group_Assignment_2/Files%20for%20week%203">Education Profile of LA County</a>, LA County & LA City Bikeway Data <br><br>
**Concerns**: <br> Major Concerns: Both team members are coding beginners, so thinking through the logic for the code has been challenging. <br> Minor Concern: Availability of up-to-date data on both biking infrastructure as well as lack of reliability of 2020 Census due to COVID.
